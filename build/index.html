 It incorporates a sophisticated infrastructure network that processes the sentiment information flowing through its communities. Using AI and neuro-technology, it refactors the sentiment information, suppressing the negatives while promoting the positives. 
 The places inside the settlement - the residential units, the offices, and the public areas, are all equipped with sentiment sensors, which construct emotional profiles of the occupants and tune the micro-environment, the temperature, the lighting, 
 the humidity, the smell, etc., to uplift the occupants’ spirits. The net effect of such a network within Anankhotopia is, as its name suggests, the diminution of the painful memories, anxiety, 
 and stress experienced by newly arrived immigrants on their way out of a drastically changed landscape on the borderland that has become increasingly fragile and hostile.</p></div><div class="idyll-scroll" id="idyll-scroll-0" style="position:relative"><div class="idyll-scroll-graphic" style="top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:auto;width:100%;transform:translate3d(0, 0, 0);z-index:-1;height:0"><div style="width:0;position:absolute;left:0;right:0;top:50%;transform:translateY(-50%)"><div class="d3-component-container"><div style="width:100%"></div></div></div></div><div class=" idyll-text-container"><div class="idyll-scroll-text"><div class="idyll-step "><h2 id="i.-a-changed-borderland">I. A Changed Borderland</h2><img src="static/images/map.png" idyll="[object Object]"/><p><br/>
    We are now in the not-so-distant future, where the landscape is drastically different from the one we were used to. The zones around the 30th parallel are particularly vulnerable and volatile where extreme drought and flood have become the norm.
    While our wealthy and tech savvy neighbor has the resources and technologies to turn these changes to their favor to some extent, we are left with a hostile landscape. The disparity between the ones who own resources and the ones who don’t has, unfortunately, 
    been exacerbated by the changed climate.</p></div><div class="idyll-step "><h2 id="ii.-a-changed-threshold">II. A Changed Threshold</h2><p><img src="static/images/disaster1.png" idyll="[object Object]"/><br/>
    Life is increasingly stressful in these shores. Many of us dream of getting to the other side of the border. We have all heard of the promised land of Anankhotopia. We have seen it on the television with our own eyes. 
    However, it is harder to get to the other side of the border now. Just like what they joke about.</p><p><br/>
    “The climate has raised the bar for us.”
    <br/><br/></p><p><img src="static/images/disaster2.png" idyll="[object Object]"/><br/>
    It is said that roughly 10 days north of the river source lies the idyllic settlement of Anankhotopia, where the toil of the trek through the harsh landscape of the borderlands finally concludes. 
    We traverse the rough roads like what happened in the old days, but the trek is much more difficult. The unpredictable sandstorm has become so frequent and the landscape has become more unstable. We lose people with whom we started the journey and we risk losing ourselves, 
    one way or another. We have to take this as a pilgrimage and have strong faith so as to make it to the end. Now I think what they always say is quite right.</p><p><br/>
    “You cannot reach Anankhotopia, it is Anankhotopia which decides if it wants to be reached by you”
  </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><h2 id="iii.-eisodos">III. Eisodos</h2><p><img src="static/images/anankho2.png" idyll="[object Object]"/><br/>
    But Anankhotopia did reach to us in the end, after around 10 days. Eisodos is what they call the entering of the city and I am one of the lucky folks who made it to their Eisodos.
    We have all heard of what it has to offer - a way out of our past. We all saw the powerful neural system that cures you of your stress before you crossed the border. This is what they say.</p><p><br/>
    “You can pass the border control, but your anxiety and painful memories won’t. The negative emotions are inspected and deported back to where they are from.”
  </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><h2 id="iv.-anxiety">IV. Anxiety</h2><p><img src="static/images/im3.jpg" idyll="[object Object]"/><br/>
    So then I will wait for this network to exert its influence on me. As of now, if I dig into myself, I can map a whole series of incarnations of anxieties in my brain.
    <br/><br/><img src="static/images/im4.jpg" idyll="[object Object]"/><br/>10 is a rough number. Even 10 days on foot like this was hard to put up with, never mind before we reached here, we all knew that 10 was a rough number. And it still is. I was having nightmares of someone taking the marine route for border crossing. 
    I have heard those stories, which usually happen further east.
    I am not sure why I dreamed of that. Maybe in extreme drought you start to fear the brine water.
  </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><h2 id="v.-the-network">V. The Network</h2><p>Let those maps of negative emotions be inhibited in the nodes so that they don’t get passed further down.
    <br/>
    Let those nodes cultivate an environment with the right temperature, humidity, smell, vegetations, lighting, so that they also cultivate positive emotions in you.

    “We live in an increasingly fragile world and coping with the external environment is a strenuous task to take on. Some of us thus turned our attentions to our internal landscape, our mind and spirit, our mental state. 
    Our internal world is a reflection of the external one and its topography changes as the external world changes. For all these years, we have been in search of an elixir for happiness, the magical potion to cure us of mental issues, so 
    that we can cope with the ever more entangled inner world in a changed climate.”
    <br/><br/><img src="static/images/net2.jpg" idyll="[object Object]"/><br/>
    “We found the answers within ourselves - the perfect design is within our own brains. All those connections, thousands, millions of connections, which individually doesn’t mean anything, when linked all together, trigger memories,
     emotions, feelings, sensations, movements, a whole orchestrated pattern, which, if looked at from a distance seems chaotic, but when zoomed in close enough, reveals the order of things. Here we found the perfect design, 
     the design that will make life more pleasant and the world a more enjoyable place to live in. We call the nodes in this design “THE CLEFTS”. When we look at neurons, they communicate with each other but they are not physically connected.
     There is a space in between, a space that is filled with chemicals, hormones, and channels. The magical mechanism that performs in these clefts controls all aspects of our senses, the way we perceive the world, how we feel, how we move. 
     The urban infrastructure that uplifts the spirit of the whole city follows such a design, a design we found within ourselves.
    ”

    In less than a month, I feel totally refreshed and am upbeat most of the time. I am ready to step out of my assigned unit and go out to explore the different zones of the city. I wish to also start to look for a job and 
    begin building my new life on this side of the border. I read that the city has four main districts, each of them having some dedicated functions.
    <br/><br/><ol><li>Sinemetu - the residential zone</li><li>Sans-souci - the business district</li><li>Buitenzorg - the central power plant that monitors the sentiment control network and infrastructure</li><li>Carefreeteria - the public spaces and parks of the city</li></ol></p></div><div class="idyll-step "><h2 id="vii.-beyond-anxiety">VII. Beyond Anxiety</h2><p><img src="static/images/interior1.png" idyll="[object Object]"/><br/>
    Back to my room, today the lights are in a warmer hue. Maybe the node has sensed that I need a softer ambient at home? There is also a decent scent in the room. I am not able to tell exactly what plant this smell is mimicking. Maybe it’s the flower of sweet olive.</p><p><br/><br/><img src="static/images/interior2.png" idyll="[object Object]"/><br/>
    Downstairs in the botanical garden of the community, the lighting is a little reddish and I can feel the air mildly humidified. It is a really relaxing walk around the space. A moment ago, I got a message telling me that I have new mails, so I decided to pay a visit to the
    mail room as well.</p></div><div class="idyll-step "><h2 id="0.-the-mails">0<!-- -->. The Mails</h2><p>The mailroom personnel gently handed me a packet of 3 envelops. What are they? Wait. They look like utility bills.
    <br/><br/><img src="static/images/utility.jpg" idyll="[object Object]"/><br/>
    I haven’t even started to make a living yet. How am I supposed to pay?
